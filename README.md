Employee mini app on Angular for testing Firestore

This is a mini application on Angular 13 for testing the use of FireStore database using the new Firestore SDK9 that uses new simplified methods and it is modularized; is disruptive with SDK8 and previous versions. Mostly for new projects otherwise, in older projects you can use the compat version... bla bla.
