## Important notice
The purpouse of this application is just to do a quick test of the Firesbase SDK 9 that is disruptive with previous versions, is based on a project that with previous versions so I had to be updated (original course with previous version https://www.udemy.com/course/app-empleado-angular-firebase/learn/lecture/26666886?start=1#reviews). 
In order to have a try of the application in your localhos you must first need to install node_modules dir and Bootstrap css framework as follows:
Install node_modules `npm install`.
Install Bootstrap `npm i bootstrap`, optionally you can do the same by cdn link (check on the bootstrap web).
